+---------------------------------+
| Backend Installations and Setup |
+---------------------------------+
Made backend folder
Install PostgreSQL 
Install PostGIS
Install pgadmin
cd backend 
npm init -y
npm i express body-parser cors dotenv helmet morgan jsonwebtoken multer uuid axios @terraformer/wkt @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/lib-storage
npm i -D rimraf concurrently nodemon shx ts-node typescript @types/cors @types/morgan @types/jsonwebtoken @types/multer @types/terraformer__wkt @types/uuid
npx tsc --init
Edited backend/tsconfig.json
Created src folder in backend
Created index.ts in backend/src Entry point for entire Application
Edited package.json
Created .env in backend
npm i prisma @prisma/client
- This has a lot of vulnerabilities going to uninstall and try a fix
npm install -g prisma
npm install @prisma/client
- Hopefully this doesnt break anything
npx prisma init
Added new prisma folder
had errors with @prisma/client
did the following fix
npm uninstall prisma @prisma/client
npm install prisma@5.15.0 @prisma/client@5.15.0
npx prisma generate
Now I have different errors... :/
Maybe fixed them hopefully. 

seedData folder has mock data 

Added Prisma by prisma.io extension

Not fixed tried following fix.
npm install prisma@6 @prisma/client@6

edited package.json added notes for changes and how they work in packagejsonnotes.txt
ran npm run prisma:generate
creates index.d.ts in frontend/src/types This step would have to happen again if I change this to a car platform
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
this initialises our migrations

prisma 7 was still installed globally and caused issues
delete prisma 7 globally

npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
creates migrations solver in backend/prisma
npm run seed
encountered error while doing so
edited seed.ts to allow npm run seed to work
npm run seed
added information to database


In backend if I want to change to a Used Car platform need to change
schema.prisma to reflect that.
Theres other stuff I need to do too.

| Properties Frontend |
+---------------------+
Had issues with landing-page not loading when signed-out 
which means the landing-page is protected with Auth but it should be visible to everyone
Tried several fixes but they broke the whole app
Rolled back to a previous version in my backups folder which is this one backup 0.7
Made it so the page auto redirects to login when someone opens the site
I don't have time to try to figure out the issue
I also made it so when someone is logged in they redirect to the landing-page
Now I gotta do properties frontend and applications frontend tonight

That seems to have fixed the vulnerability but does the code still run?
Seems to be working

npm run build
ran with no issues

Finally at AWS THANK GOD!

AWS Architecture ******IMPORTANT********
Make sure to make graph or visual for the architecture
VPC is the API Gateway
EC2 has backend 
There are 2 private subnets needed for RDS for different availability zones 
Amplify for hosting nextjs

AWS Networking
--------------
Go to VPC
us-west-2
Create VPC
- VPC only
- lucky-star-vpc
- IPv4 CIDR manual input
- 10.0.0.0/16
- create vpc
Create subnet (in our VPC)
subnet 1 of 2
- Select the VPC
- lucky-star-public-subnet-1
- us-west-2a
- 10.0.0.0/24
subnet 2 of 2
- lucky-star-private-subnet-1
- us-west-2a
- 10.0.0.0/16
- 10.0.1.0/24
add subnet 3 of 3
- lucky-star-private-subnet-2
- us-west-2b
- 10.0.0.0/16
- 10.0.2.0/24

Create internet Gateway
- lucky-star-internet-gateway
- attach to our vpc

Create Route Table
- lucky-star-public-route-table-1
- select VPC
- create route table
Edit subnet associations
- associate the public subnet with the public round table

Create Route Table
- lucky-star-private-route-table-1
- select VPC
- create route table
Edit subnet associations
- associate the private 1 subnet with the private 1 round table
Create Route Table
- lucky-star-private-route-table-2
- select VPC
- create route table
Edit subnet associations
- associate the private 2 subnet with the private 2 round table

Got to Route Tables click on the public one click Edit routes
- Add route
- 0.0.0.0/0 
-Internet Gateway
- pick our gateway


AWS EC2
-------
Launch Instance 
lucky-star-ec2
amazon linux
free tier eligible
keep everything the same
create new key pair 
Allow SSH traffic
Allow HTTPS and HTTP traffic
Edit network settings
change vpc to public subnet 1
enable auto assign public IP 
lucky-star-ec2-security-group security group name
security group rules 
launch instance

connect to ec2 instance 
sudo su -
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install node
node -v
npm -v
Amazon Linux 2 does not have libatomic.so.1 so this fails
Fix:
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
node -v
npm -v





sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install git -y
git --version
git clone https://github.com/rlcruz324/CSPC454_Final_Project.git
cd CSPC454_Final_Project
cd backend
npm i
echo "PORT=80" > .env
npm run dev


pm2 in case project crashes
npm i pm2 -g
module.exports = { apps : [{ name: 'lucky-star-real-estate', script: 'npm', args: 'run dev', env: { NODE_ENV: 'development', ENV_VAR1: 'environment-variable', } }], };
nano ecosystem.config.js
sudo env PATH=$PATH:$(which node) $(which pm2) startup systemd -u $USER --hp $(eval echo ~$USER)
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js


To edit code later.
ssh ec2-user@34.220.42.236
cd CSPC454_Final_Project/backend
git pull
npm i
pm2 restart all
# or
pm2 restart inventory-management
API gateway to connect the the backend from the frontend http routes


AWS RDS
--------
Create database
PostgreSQL
lucky-star-database
postgres is master username
masterpassword is secret saved it to a local txt file
disable storage autoscaling to prevent charges
pick the VPC
new vpc security group name
ls-rds-sg

go to the security group
edit inbound rules
add the security group ls-ec2-sg to source

go to ec2 instance 
click security
check outbound rules
edit outbound rules
add the secrity group ls-rds-sg

go back to ec2 instance connection
pm2 delete all
pm2 suddenly not working
tried this fix
sudo su -
export NVM_DIR=/home/ec2-user/.nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
pm2 restart all
did not work
trying this
sudo npm i -g pm2
npm is not installed?
installed it again and it fixed the problem

pm2 delete all
nano .env
add the new database url 
npm run prisma:generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run seed
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 monit


AWS Amplify
-----------
Deploy and app
Connect to github
pick the repository
main
my app is a monorepo
frontend
there should be an option for create and use a new service role but i dont see it
Advanced settings
add .env variables
keep cookies in cache key
save and deploy
changes in github will reflect automatically

went to IAM to create the role manually but looks like it was already made.


AWS Api Gateway
---------------
Create Api
Rest Api (So we can use cognito auth)
Create Rest Api
lucky-star-api-gateway
forces you to use a security policy now which is not in the tutorial.
I picked SECURITYPOLICY_TLS13_1_2_2021_06 (hopefully that is fine)
IP address type i picked Dualstack I didnt see the same options as the tutorial and theres new options that were not there. Tutorial had API endpoint type regional but thats not visible to me. 

Create resource
proxy resource
{proxy+}
CORS
select ANY and hi edit integration
HTTP
HTTP proxy integration
HTTP method ANY
use ec2 instance as Endpoint URL http://34.220.42.236/{proxy}

now i need to make a cognito authorizer 

click authorizers in the api gateway thingy
create authorizer
lucky-star-api-gateway-cognito-authorizer
click cognito
lucky-star-estates_congnito-userpool
create

back to resources click ANY
go to method request settings and hit edit
click the authorizer just made

create resource
/
properties

create method for properties
GET 
HTTP
http proxy integration
GET
http://34.220.42.236/{proxy}

deploy api
new stage 
prod 
deploy

https://35711dw219.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod

Going back to amplify
environment variables
manage variables
replaced NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL 

go back to overview and redeploy

ookay gonna go to deploy url and pray to the coding gods i can sign in. 

Settings in tenant is not working oh my god 
dont freak out lets finish deploying and then we can try fixing it
for now just focus on meeting the minimum requirements for the project
it might be bacause this user is not in the training data and needs to be added somehow
tried to run npm run seed but it hangs
could be an issue with a security group
god i want to cry so bad but this isnt my only project and if i cry it stalls the whole process
do i really need to figure this out to get at least a C in this?
idk
seeding works now but it did not solve the problem so back to square 1
i tried everythingits been 12 hours im sick of this
i jus twant to sleep so bad its been 3 days but i dont have time
i dont think the congnito users are being added to the database...but why not?

Im just going to start over maybe I was rushing the aws setup or something idk


i been sitting here for 18 hours!!!!aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i wish aws didnt exist 

ec2 commands i need for every reboot
sudo su -
nvm use 18
cd CSPC454_Final_Project/backend
npm run dev
npm run seed
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

alright its 4am i just redid everything from the beginning for aws
up to this point
i can only hope this works now
waiting for it to finish deploying
god please please please i worked so hard please
i should have stayed an english major
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
OH MY GOD IT WORKS HOLY 
i never want to do this again


AWS S3
------
create bucket
general Purpose
lucky-star-s3-images
turn off block all public access since this is just images
i left on versioning since we did that in another class assignment

click on the bucket click on permissions
edit bucket policy 

ITS NOT WORKING AGAIN AND ITS THE SAME ISSUE OH MY GOD
okay lets think all that i did before the issue returned was edit the .env in the ec2 instance
while i was doing that my laptop died
i had to reconnect to the ec2 instance
so it is something i need to redo or something
a step i need to redo
could be i didnt do something
I was so close to the end i could have slept today
cant connect to the instance again
gonna reboot
this is such a bummer
will this even work when i present
i just want to sleep pleeeease
okay its working again
the issue comes from ec2 if i skip commands 

add new property does not work
ill figure it out later its not that important probably
im just gonna have to turn in a buggy mess huh


+-------------------+
| Cleanup / Changes |
+-------------------+
Edited/Cleaned backend
Made the changes in ec2 
seems like everything is running smoothly


Somehow i broke it even worse than before and i feel so defeated 
i think if i ever get it back up an running again that i will just leave it alone 
i gotta get ready to go to class. i hate how i lose 8 hours of my day to travel and class 
i really need that time to work on the project ...
ec2 is being completely unresponsive for an hour




+----------------------------------+
| Issues encountered while testing |
+----------------------------------+

Issue: Mapbox seems to be having an unknown console error and the map is invisible in the bottom of the property details page.
Fixed: Issue was a typo in the map link whoops

Issue: There is a next.js error in the manager page but information provided is not giving me clues to what it is. I does not seem to be effecting the apps ability to run. I might need to come back to it later.
It looks like a promise error. Hmmmm. 

Issue: Signin sometimes returns a 404 and we see the 404 for a brief second but then it loads properly.

Issue: Search Bar is janky and only accepts exact coordinates or address but not zip code or city.


Issue: Add new property does not work. I think the issue has to do with the s3 bucket.
Fixed: fixed the .env in ec2 and added an IAM role to ec2 for s3bucket

Issue: The image is in the s3 bucket when i make a new property but it does not show in the app. 
I think the link is wrong.


Issue: The ec2 needs me to run npm run dev everytime I want to check my app
Solution: run the following
pm2 save
pm2 startup systemd

Issue: shadcn button is too dark to read
